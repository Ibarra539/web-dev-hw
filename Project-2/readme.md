# Project 2

I have taken a couple web development classes now so most of what we have covered so far are all things I have learned in other classes.  The main things that are new in this class is utilizing Atom as a web development tool, and the way the assignments are structured have helped me retain more of the lesson's materials.

As for CSS I am excited to begin creating more visually appealing websites.  It is an extremely useful tool for utilizing many different design choices at once, and I am excited to add some variation in the course work.

My work schedule for this project was a little more hectic than normal since I have been playing catch up from my trip to Japan.  Not to mention I interviewed twice over the last couple weeks with a company called PwC, and have been in the final stages of accepting an offer of employment with their Seattle office after graduation.  For these reasons I haven't been able to give this project as much time as I normally would have so I am expecting a lower grade than most of my assignments.  However, I have done my best to fulfill all the project requirements, and am proud of my instructable.
