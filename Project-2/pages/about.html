  <p> When growing up there are three major life skills every boy must learn on his quest to manhood.  Tieing a tie, shaving, and hunting a wild boar with a knife & stick.  Ok the last one may be a joke unless you're named Rambo and are forced into the hills by a malicious sheriff, but you really should know how to tie a tie.
  Once you learn to tie a basic tie then there are also many different variations that can be used including the Four-in-Hand, Half-Windsor, Kelvin, Prince Albert, Pratt, Eldredge, Van Wijk, Trinity, Murrell, Balthus, and Bow Ties.  </p>
