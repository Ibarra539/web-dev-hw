The relationship between an IP Address and DNS is that DNS is what takes an IP
Address, translates that address into its associated website name, and sends
the user to that IP Address.  DNS is important because it keeps us from needing
know an exact IP Address, and instead allows us to search for our requested IP
Address through the associated wording.  So instead of typing in 8.8.8.8 or
8.8.4.4 to reach Google.com the user can just enter the words, and reach the
same location.

A cookie is basically an ID card that allows a website to remember who visits

with any subsequent requests from the same user so that all the user activity is
logged to that user ID.

The three basic parts of a URL are protocol, domain, path & file.
