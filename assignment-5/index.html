  <h1>Pillow Talking by Lil Dicky Lyrics</h1>
    <p>Ay, ay, damn <br />
      L tapped twice on some ass, like grams <br />
      I just fucked <br />
      Now what I'm doing? <br />
      <br />
      I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy <br />
      I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy (Do you fuck with the war?) <br />
      I just finished spazzing on a bitch, ayy <br />
      Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch <br />
      <br />
      I'm like, "Girl, that was great, talk about a connection <br />
      Am I alone in my praise, do you share my assessment?" <br />
      She like, "Yeah, that was nice, I enjoyed myself" <br />
      "Great," "Yeah" <br />
      She like, "Can you reach that shelf for my phone? I'll take care the alarm" <br />
      I'm like, "Oh, for the morning, like, to sleep?"  <br />
      She like, "Yeah, we just had sex, what did you think? <br />
      I was just gonna fuck you and leave?" <br />
      "No, I— I hadn't thought that far ahead <br />
      But of course, can I get you a t-shirt— <br />
      Oh, can you not tickle my hair? <br />
      It's just a personal thing, it's not you" <br />
      "Okay, sorry for doing it" <br />
      "No, no, it’s just a personal thing, it’s not you" <br />
      "Okay, cool" <br />
      "Yeah, uh, so, you're from Minnesota? <br />
      Only thing I know is that it's colder <br />
      Break it down, how's it compare to living in LA?" <br />
      "Well, I can't compare them, they're so different <br />
      Y'know what I'm sayin'?" <br />
      "Yeah, for sure" <br />
      She like, "Apples to oranges" <br />
      "Yeah, well, you can still compare them, but I hear you <br />
      What's the deal with your family? Got any siblings?" <br />
      She like, "I have a brother," I'm like, "Oh, what he do?" <br />
      She like, "He in the Army," "Oh, true <br />
      Uh, do you fuck with the war?" <br />
      She like "Huh? What did you just say?" <br />
      "Huh? Like, just now?" "Yeah" <br />
      "Do you fuck with the war?" <br />
      "No, I don't fuck with the war" <br />
      I'm like "No, I don't fuck with the war! <br />
      Just don't know how to react to the forces <br />
      I should have just thanked you, of course—" <br />
      "Uh, why would you thank me?" <br />
      "Uh, I guess I assumed it extended to families, but okay <br />
      <br />
      While we on the topic, I been actually thinkin' about some shit <br />
      About the Army and Navy <br />
      What if tomorrow is the day <br />
      That the fucking aliens came <br />
      And invaded our nation? <br />
      Like, would we even be able to fuck with their shit? <br />
      Like, do we got the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships? <br />
      Or not at all, like, would they just walk up in this motherfucker <br />
      Laughin' at us, and blastin' at us <br />
      And makin' everybody disintegrate and assimilate <br />
      Without a hint of intimidation? <br />
      Or could we do some shit to be making they heart race? <br />
      Granted I don't know the alien heart, but <br />
      You get what the fuck I'm saying? <br />
      Like what the fuck would it be like? <br />
      Would they be like "Earth go hard" <br />
      Or is it just another conquest? <br />
      Or would they be like, "Damn, Earth go hard" <br />
      "They was harder than Simian" <br />
      You ever talk to your brother about this, uh, type of stuff?" <br />
      Then she like, "No" <br />
      I'm like "Well, what you think?" <br />
      She like "I don't concern myself <br />
      With hypotheticals that couldn't be" <br />
      I'm like, "Girl, what you mean?" <br />
      She like, "I don't believe" <br />
      "In the war?" <br />
      "In aliens" <br />
      "Oh, hold up, hold up, wait <br />
      Girl, what you sayin'? <br />
      That all of the life in the universe happens to be where you stand?" <br />
      "I guess" <br />
      "What an enormous coincidence that shit would be <br />
      Do you see what I'm sayin'?" <br />
      "I can't hear what you're sayin'" <br />
      "Well, the universe always expanding <br />
      There are infinite galaxies (infinite) <br />
      Why would we be the anomaly?" <br />
      She like "That's no coincidence, I call that shit God" <br />
      I'm like "Oh, you're religious, bitch <br />
      You think it's all God?" <br />
      "No, I know it's all God" <br />
      "No, I know that there might be a God <br />
      First off, nobody knows there's a God <br />
      Girl, I think we should drop this" <br />
      "No, what's goin' on in your brain right now?" <br />
      <br />
      Ayy, Brain on some other shit though <br />
      I been all up in the club for the year, hey <br />
      I been killing shit, don't mind me, uhI'm just top flight <br />
      Uh, I could sure use a Sprite <br />
      I'm thirsty as fuck <br />
      Who getting money? That's Brain <br />
      Who make decisions? That's Brain <br />
      Who make the hits? That been Brain <br />
      Who run the whole operation? That been Brain since— <br />
      Brain, can you just get back to the issue here <br />
      Uh, "Really?" Can you just remind the Brain? <br />
      "You're such an idiot, we're talking about God and if He exists" <br />
      Don't call Brain names <br />
      The Brain couldn't recall <br />
      But if I'm not mistaken, this bitch to my left <br />
      Guaranteed there's a God <br />
      "I believe in a God, yes" <br />
      So, God never wrong? <br />
      God never wrong, right? <br />
      "Yeah, that's, like, the whole point" <br />
      "Brain, just get there, please" <br />
      Hold up <br />
      So, God made the Earth <br />
      And God was like, hold up, this shit is boring <br />
      It need more shit <br />
      God was like, "I'ma put dinosaurs on that bitch <br />
      Dinosaurs on that bitch" <br />
      Then He like, "Why I put dinosaurs on that shit?" <br />
      "What is your brain even saying? <br />
      Can he get to the point?" <br />
      “Hold up, Brain, you just did it <br />
      God ain't wrong, what the fuck was He thinking?” <br />
      “About what?” <br />
      “Bitch, the dinosaurs <br />
      He made the Earth for them <br />
      But then He like, 'Nah'? <br />
      'Dinosaurs are just blah'?” <br />
      ”What's your point?” <br />
      “'I'ma cook up some blondes'? <br />
      Like, He was way off <br />
      I don't look like a dinosaur <br />
      Ho, them things thirty-five feet <br />
      I'm like five-foot eleven” (Up on Tinder, I'm six-foot) <br />
      “Seen that Bronchiosaurus? <br />
      That thing fuckin' neck go to heaven (Good shit Brain) <br />
      And that's just an expression, bitch <br />
      There ain't no heaven” <br />
      ”Ha, funny” <br />
      “I'm just messin', but if he ain't wrong <br />
      I guess this the exception” <br />
      ”Can I talk now?” <br />
      “Go ahead” <br />
      <br />
      ”Look, everything in life has purpose <br />
      You, chickens, a midget at a circus” <br />
      “What? I don't interpret” <br />
      She like, ”That's not for me to determine” <br />
      “So dinosaurs' purpose was to just die?” <br />
      ”That's not for me to determine” <br />
      “But—okay” <br />
      ”I'm just a person” <br />
      “Okay, but think of the root of the argument, girl <br />
      View how we started this, girl <br />
      Like, you don't believe in the aliens" <br />
      "Yeah, I just—" <br />
      "You confine God to Earth, girl, I find that shit salient” <br />
      ”I just don't presume to know the plan” <br />
      “Bitch, me neither, but that's not what I've been saying” <br />
      ”But what are you saying?” <br />
      “Why can't God fuck with aliens? <br />
      Why can't Earth just be like <br />
      A fuckin' small side project for this guy?” <br />
      ”Okay, look, we just don't see eye to eye” <br />
      “Yeah, but logically, like, you don't believe in your side” <br />
      ”Yeah, but you're, like, bringing up fuckin' dinosaurs <br />
      Like, we could have shared the Earth with them, nobody knows” <br />
      “Yeah, there is hard soil evidence, girl <br />
      Like what's next, you don't fuck with Pangaea?” <br />
      She like, ”Let’s change the subject” <br />
      “Okay” <br />
      This bitch don't know 'bout Pangaea <br />
      "Brain, leave it alone" <br />
      <br />
      “I'm starving, are you hungry, by chance?” <br />
      ”Oh, my God, I'm so hungry” <br />
      “Yes, do you wanna get a pizza?” <br />
      ”Fuck yeah” <br />
      “Fuck yeah, I'm on it <br />
      Also, I'm sorry about that whole interrogation thing” <br />
      "Come on, dude, I'm a grown up <br />
      I'm capable of having intelligent conversations” <br />
      “Okay, I just—fuck it <br />
      Okay, back to this pizza, I lean pepperoni” <br />
      ”Ugh” <br />
      “Sausage?” <br />
      ”How can you eat that shit?” <br />
      “No, no, no, this not Domino's, this legit <br />
      It's high quality meat and shit” <br />
      ”No, no, I'm vegetarian” <br />
      “Oh, right, well, we can get half pepperoni <br />
      And half of whatever you like” <br />
      ”Ugh, ew, I can't have that shit in the same box” <br />
      “Seriously? You're that against meat?” <br />
      ”No, I'm that against us being gluttonous <br />
      Thinkin' that animals live on this earth to get eat” <br />
      “Okay, is it how we treat them?” <br />
      ”Uh, that sure doesn't help” <br />
      “Okay” <br />
      She like, ”I'm not opposed to us hunting <br />
      But now we not trackin' them down <br />
      We just breed them to eat, that's disgusting <br />
      You should honestly read on the subject” <br />
      “Alright, hold up <br />
      <br />
      Just because we're not running around with a bow and arrow <br />
      Doesn't mean we're not hunting these chickens <br />
      We just set the place to do our hunting intelligently enough <br />
      To manipulate these animals and get them to do exactly what we want” <br />
      ”That's my point, we just incubate animals <br />
      Instead of just letting them live how they come” <br />
      “But, that's just your God at work, bitch <br />
      Why we go hard on Earth <br />
      What you think would happen right now if you left my place <br />
      And there were like three wolves waiting for you?” <br />
      ”Wolves?” <br />
      “Bitch, they would tear your ass up! <br />
      Viciously, like, they would eat your titties” <br />
      And your pussy <br />
      “That's what they do” <br />
      And your face and shit <br />
      “Humans are smarter, bitch, that's what we do” <br />
      She like, ”Apples to oranges” <br />
      “Bitch, that phrase don't make no sense! <br />
      Why can't fruit be compared?” <br />
      She like, ”I'm gonna leave” <br />
      “There's just all of these conflicting principles” <br />
      ”Right, enjoy your pepperoni pizza” <br />
      “I will, that's my God-given right” <br />
      She like, ”Where is my bag?” <br />
      “Oh, that leather one next to the trash? <br />
      That's the one, right? Made out of cow, I think?” <br />
      ”Ugh, why are there no Ubers in this area?” <br />
      “So you don't eat the meat, you just be wearing the shit” <br />
      ”I'm not listening, dude” <br />
      “That's barbaric as shit <br />
      Do you come from the vikings?" <br />
      ”Why are you even still talking?” <br />
      “Do you take peoples' land?” <br />
      ”I'm not listening, dude” <br />
      “Do you fuck with the war?” <br />
      ”How are there no Ubers anywhere?” <br />
      “Just download Lyft, they are bigger in presence out here” <br />
      ”I don't wanna add shit to my phone” <br />
      “Okay, the choices are clear, ho <br />
      Ubers are not around here, ho <br />
      Taxis will come, but they real slow” <br />
      And the Brain gotta poop <br />
      T minus five 'til the Brain gotta shit <br />
      ”I just downloaded Lyft, but it's being so glitchy" <br />
      “Uh, look, do you just want to sleep here?” <br />
      ”Uh, no thanks” <br />
      “It's past 2 am” <br />
      ”I'm not sharing a bed with you” <br />
      “You can sleep in my bed, I'll just sleep on the floor” <br />
      ”Fine, you're sure?” <br />
      “Yeah, it's cool <br />
      I won't throw you out to the wolves” <br />
      ”Oh, my God, you are so annoying” <br />
      “I couldn't help myself <br />
      But can you at least throw me a pillow?” <br />
      <br />
      I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy <br />
      I'm just pillow talking with a bitch, ayy (Do you fuck with the war?) <br />
      I just finished spazzing on a bitch, ayy <br />
      Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch <br />
      <br />
      Brain gotta poop, still <br />
      Please don't neglect the brain <br />
      Please don't neglect the brain <br />
      "Hold on, is that my Lyft? I don't know if I—" <br />
      "Nah, I got a pizza <br />
      Full pepperoni, too <br />
      So, you're not gonna wanna be a part of it" <br />
      But first, you should poop <br />
      Please don't neglect the brain <br />
