# Project 1 Read Me

Browsers I use to "surf" the web are Firefox, and Google Chrome.
These browsers work relatively the same.  The one big difference is that one is controlled by Google while the other is open sourced.  They have back, forward, refresh, home, and bookmarking icons.  They use tabs to view multiple web pages at once.

I didn't spend a lot of time exploring the Wayback Machine.  The site I chose to visit was Myspace.com.  It was the social media website that was popular during my high school years.  The unexpected thing I found was that in 2000 Myspace.com was actually a free consumer service.  It didn't become the "Myspace" I knew until 2003.

My workcycle for this assignment involved doing the excercises in the weekly lessons, and then completed the assignment step by step.  I chose the specific song I used because I have been listening to Ed Sheeran a lot recently.  His songs are all filled with meaning, and things I can relate to.
I didn't encounter any problems or issues when coding this assignment.
Finally, I have taken a web development course so the only new thing I learned was how to publish a site using GitHub Pages.
