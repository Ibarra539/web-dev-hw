    <h2>Save Myself</h2>

    <h3>Ed Sheeran</h3>
      <hr />

      <p>I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe <br />
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak <br />
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me? <br />
Oh, honestly?<br />
<br />
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon <br />
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm <br />
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song<br />
It goes on and on<br />
<br />
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels <br />
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills <br />
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf <br />
No farewell <br />
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself <br />
<br />
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain <br />
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or dream <br />
What line do we stand upon 'cause from here looks the same? <br />
And only scars remain <br />
<br />
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels <br />
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills <br />
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf <br />
No farewell <br />
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself <br />
