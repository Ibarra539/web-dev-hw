# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo

I have decided to take this class because I have already taken the Intro to Web Development Computer Science course, and I am curious to see how it differs from the Media Arts program course.

* I already knew that the internet wasn't controlled by anyone, but it was interesting to see how many people didn't.
* I also found it interesting that the first "successful" message sent over the internet ultimately caused the system to crash.
* Finally I found it interesting that some people estimate every web page is 19 clicks away from every other web page when so little of the internet is actually accessed.  Besides for Facebook, Youtube, Google, and the other social media programs how many people actually explore the internet?  That is something I would like to learn.
